Other Versions
--------------

**OS X**: Will not happen as I can't find a feture in the display server to achive this, and my stance on apple hardware. Feel free to make your own version, I dont have a trademark on the name, but Im kindly asking you to link to this repo

**iOS**: Never, as 1. Too expensive 2. iOS is to locked down for it to work for the larger market.

**Linux and BSD**: Almost happening, just working out how x11 works

**Android**: I NEED TO LEARN JAVA
